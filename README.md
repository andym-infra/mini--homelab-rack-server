# Mini Homelab Rack

## Overview
Designed and built a compact 10-inch mini server rack to host my home infrastructure lab. The goal was to simulate an enterprise-style environment using real hardware and structured networking.

## Hardware
- Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Mini (Ubuntu Server / Docker services)
- Dell OptiPlex 5090 (Proxmox node)
- Managed Network Switch
- 10-inch Patch Panel
- Structured Ethernet cabling
- Rack-mounted power management

## Virtual Infrastructure
- Proxmox Virtual Environment
- Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory)
- DNS & Domain Services
- Linux-based services (Docker containers)
- Secure remote access configuration

## Network Design
- Internal LAN segmentation
- Domain-based authentication
- Centralized DNS
- Structured cabling via patch panel

## Objectives
- Practice enterprise infrastructure setup
- Improve physical cable management
- Learn network topology planning
- Integrate physical and virtual systems

## What I Learned
- Rack planning & device placement
- Network organization best practices
- Importance of DNS in AD environments
- Physical + virtual infrastructure integration
